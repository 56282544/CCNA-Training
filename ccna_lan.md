#Local Area Networks
A LAN is a network for computers and other compents that are located relatively close together in a limited area.

##Need for Switches
..* Operate at the link layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite
..* Forward, filter, or flood frames based on the MAC table entries

###Duplex
In a **full duplex** system, both parties can communicate with each otehr simultaneously
In a **half duplex** ssytem, there are still two clearly defined paths/channels, and each part can communicate with the other but not simultaneously; the communication is one direction at a time.

##Switches
LAN switch characteristics
..* High port density
..* Large frame buffers
..* Mixture of port speeds
..* Fast internal switching
..* Low per-port cost
